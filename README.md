# Three JS - Tower Builder

This repo contains a bare-bones of what will become a Three js Tower Builder game `hopefully`.


## Getting started

Clone this repository and install its dependencies:

```bash
clone
cd threejs-tower-builder
npm install
```

`npm run build` builds the application to `public/bundle.js`, along with a sourcemap file for debugging.

`npm start` launches a server, using [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve) and [livereload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-livereload) plugin. Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

`npm run watch` will continually rebuild the application as your source files change.

`npm run dev` will run `npm start` and `npm run watch` in parallel.
